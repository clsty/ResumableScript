# ResumableScript
This Bash function(script) enhances control on execution and resilience on error handling.

With this function(script) added before a command, user will be propmted an option to execute the command, skip the command or exit.
And if the command failed to execute, user will be prompted an option to repeat this command (after manually solving the problem), ignore the error or exit.

# History
The function `v` is originally created as an ask-before-doing function for making improvements on the installation script of [end-4/dots-hyprland (branch: illogical_impulse)](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland/tree/illogical-impulse). This function is written all by myself.
I iteratively improved it again and again. About several dozen hours on it was spent in total.
So, to save this heavy work for future me and other people using some bash scripts, I decided to create this repo.
